# nrg2flac
Though the name of project is `nrg2flac`, the only function works now is to turn an nrg file into seperate wav files.

## usage
Run in command line or simply drag the image file with `.nrg` suffix upon the program.
```shell
nrg2flac.exe image.nrg
```

The outputs would be in a folder created same where the image file is.
